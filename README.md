# Grab_The_Cash / Grab_The_Ballon D'ors
Game made with pygame, where you collect Ballon Dors and dodge Messi. 

Originally I needed to do a game on a course for Helsinki University "Ohjelmoinnin perusteet ja jatkokurssi 2023" and I decided to continue and make it better.

My first small game created alone, the game is pretty self explanatory but had good fun making it.

For testing you can clone the repo and just run Grab_The_Ballon_Dors.py file.
If you want to play the robot version on line 8 choose 1, for the Ballon dor version choose 2.
Good luck beating this one!
